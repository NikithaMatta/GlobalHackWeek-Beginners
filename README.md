# Global Hack Week - Beginners Challenges

Welcome to my **Global Hack Week - Beginners** project repository! This repository contains a series of coding challenges and projects completed as part of Global Hack Week - Beginners, organized by Major League Hacking (MLH).

Each challenge is saved in its own folder with a dedicated `README.md` file that describes the problem, solution, and any additional instructions needed to run the code.
